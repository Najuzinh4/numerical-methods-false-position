# Numerical Computational Calculus – Work 1

## 📌 Description
This repository contains the solutions for **Work 1 of the Numerical Computational Calculus course (UNESP, 2025)**.

The work includes:
1. Analytical solutions for Exercises 1 and 2 (submitted in PDF format).
2. Computational implementation of the **False Position Method** to find the root of the function:

\[
f(x) = \ln(x) - \sin(x)
\]

with a precision of **ε = 10⁻⁹**.

---

## 🧮 Exercise 3 – Programming
The code was developed in **R** (the language recommended by the professor) to numerically find the root of the proposed function.

The execution result is stored in a separate file (`resultado.txt`), as instructed in the problem statement.

---

## 🚀 Execution
To run the code in R:

1. Open RStudio or a terminal with R installed.
2. Execute the script:
   ```r
   source("codigo.R")
The result will be displayed in the console and saved in the resultado.txt file.
